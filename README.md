Flask - BOILER PLATE
======

Create a Flask base with lots of useful modules (sqlAlchemy, admin, script, migrate... see "requirements.txt" for all)
I made a shell script to quickly generate a new project which make :
 -  a new SQl base (ready to use thanx to migrate module) and create associate user
 - a virtualenv associate
 - a config.py associate

See flask-go-fast on my repo
